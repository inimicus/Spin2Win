# Spin2Win

Sure, you can spin to win. But _can you quantify_ how much winning you did from all your spinning?

Now you can!

## Functionality
- Tracks total spins (Whirlwind, Whirling Blades, Steel Tornado)
- Doesn't judge you if you haven't yet morphed Whirlwind or use Whirling Blades
- Displays total wins (killing blows against a player using the aforementioned skills)

## Planned Features
- Toggleable lifetime and session spin/win statistics (currently just session-based)
- Manual statistics reset
- Post to chat, share how much winning you did!

## Known Issues
- Battlegrounds tracking has not been thoroughly tested (read: at all)

This is a *BETA* addon. Surely there are plenty of issues that are yet to be known. Please report any you find.
