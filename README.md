# Spin2Win

Sure, you can spin to win. But _can you quantify_ how much winning you did from all your spinning?

Now you can!

## Functionality
- Tracks total spins (Whirlwind, Whirling Blades, Steel Tornado)
- Doesn't judge you if you haven't yet morphed Whirlwind or use Whirling Blades
- Displays total wins (killing blows against a player using the aforementioned skills)
- Toggleable lifetime, session, and account spin/win statistics
- Manual statistics reset
- Post to chat, share how much winning you did, type /s2wreport in chat
- Disables display and tracking when Spin to Win isn't slotted

## Feedback
